Dependencies
------------

The NClose code has been developed on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron release).

1. Low-Level Virtual Machine LLVM
=================================
The NClose code is designed to run in the LLVM development environment for experimental investigations and purpose.

LLVM version 2.8svn was compiled and installed (See: http://llvm.org/) and the NClose code is designed to be copied under the llvm/projects/sample directory.  It then can use the LLVM Makefile architecture.

The directory architecture under llvm/projects/sample is:
    tools/sample The NClose compiler
and various NClose interpreters or servers:
    tools/runner 
    tools/couch
    tools/server
    tools/gtk
    tools/http
The root directory contains example knowledge base and prologue files, DTD files and additional information such as this file.

2. Other dependencies
=====================
Various tools depend on properly installed libraries or systems:

curl and libcurl: Version 7.18.0; See: http://curl.haxx.se/

Apache CouchDB: Version 0.10.1; See: http://couchdb.apache.org/

GTK+ 2.0: Part of Gnome

Apache Xerces: Version 3.1.1; See: http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/

jansson: Version 1.3; See: http://www.digip.org/jansson/

GNU libmicrohttpd: from svn; See: http://www.gnu.org/software/libmicrohttpd

lighttpd: Version 1.4.28; See: http://www.lighttpd.net/

jQuery: current version; See: http://jquery.com/


Installing and Building
-----------------------
Once the files and directories have been copied to llvm/projects/samples, Makefiles in this directory, in the tools directory and subdirectories need to be reviewed for proper location of the dependency libraries.

More specifically the following Makefile variables may require adjustments:

xerces_builddir

CPP_FLAGS

ExtraLibs

as required according to the location of the installed libraries.

The tools, the NClose compiler and a suite of NClose interpreters and servers, are built in the llvm/projects/sample directory by issuing the command:

make

This builds all executable in the llvm/projects/sample/Debug/bin directory.  (During compilation a warning on converting object pointer to function pointer is emitted for each executable being built.)

The documentation is constructed also in the llvm/projects/sample directory by issuing the command:

doxygen

The HTML documentation is stored in the llvm/project/sample/docs/html

Experimenting and running the executables is also done from the llvm/projects/sample directory as it contains some example knowledge bases and XML/DTD files.
